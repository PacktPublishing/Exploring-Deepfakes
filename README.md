## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter05.

The code will look like the following:
```
masker = BiSeNet(n_classes=19)
if device == "cuda":
 masker.cuda()
model_path = os.path.join(".", "binaries",
 "BiSeNet.pth")
masker.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path))
masker.eval()
desired_segments = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for AI developers, data scientists, and anyone looking to learn more about deepfakes or techniques and technologies from Deepfakes to help them generate new image data. Working knowledge of Python programming language and basic familiarity with OpenCV, Pillow, Pytorch, or Tensorflow is recommended to get the most out of the book.
